    "When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, 'Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away!' When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied: 'If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?'",
    "Aim for a love that reminds you of the devotion The Sun has to The Moon. Whether she is in fractions or she is whole, he still shrouds his intense light in the darkness of the night. To give her the entire sky, without judgment, so she can shine in any way she wants to. You deserve someone who adores you on the days you are in broken fragments too. You deserve someone who lets you glow in every way you need to.",
    "Deep into that darkness peering, Long, I stood there, wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals. Ever dared to dream before, But the silence was unbroken, And the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken. Was the whispered word, “Lenore!” This I whispered, and an echo. Murmured back the word, “Lenore!” Merely this, and nothing more.",
    "Close your eyes and think about that boy. Please tell me how he makes you feel. Let your mind trace over his tired shoulders. Allow your thoughts to linger on that beautiful smile. Take a deep breath and try to put those dark thoughts aside. For once, let go of the reins you've wrapped so tightly around your heart. I know you are scared. Who could blame you? Love is a hurricane wrapped inside a chrysalis. And you are a girl walking into the storm.",
    "Sometimes two people, no matter how hard they try to make it work, just aren't meant to be. Love can do strange things to you, but it shouldn't ever make you forget your worth. When you least expect it, someone great will come along. Someone who will teach you all the things you got wrong about love. When you finally cross paths with the right person, everything will feel different. Be patient, because you deserve the world.",
    "Let yourself be sad, let yourself be a mess. But promise yourself that you'll try harder each day. That's all you can do. Take it day by day, and you'll learn that all this time maybe you deserved more. A beautiful thing happens when you give your heart time to heal itself. You find happiness again, and when you do, you know it because of how far you've come when you thought you'd lost all hope, And if that's not something to look forward to, find it!",
    "It has been another challenging day, my heart hurts a lot at this present moment in time but I know tests and trials are a way for me to get closer to you. I know that you a certain people in my life for a reason and you have taken certain people away for a reason. My heart hurts, my soul aching with pain but the only thing that gets me through every single day is knowing that I have got you by my side for that I thank you.",
    "You will come to realize that growth isn't this comfortable, miraculous thing. It can get ugly, and it can get confusing. It is gritty, It is hard to be a person who does things differently, But it is the greatest gift you will ever give yourself. It will push you toward figuring out what your version of happiness looks like, and when you figure out what matters to you. life is about making yourself proud on your own. it is about finding happiness that works for you.",
    "There will always be places that don't welcome you, people who don't want you in their lives, and dreams that just don't work out. But that doesn't mean that there aren't other people who would love to have you in their lives. And that doesn't mean to be in a better place. Maybe you're meant to reach higher dreams than the ones that you have planned. So don't despair, trust in fate, and go for what you truly believe is the best thing for you and it will work out."
